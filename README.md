This is the Travel Bucket List, an app designed to allow a user to track their destination dreams.
It allows you to track whether you've been to a certain location or would still like to go.
You are able to add new countries to the app and edit them if required. 
Within each country you can access cities found in that country, edit and delete them when and if required.
There are popular attractions attached to each city, along with a review of the attraction. 
There is access to all countries, all cities and all attractions at the top of the page in the nav bar.# project
